# QOTD Eevee

A Discord bot for asking Question of the Day regularly.<br/>
Written specifically for friends' Discord servers.<br/>
A lot of the code is referenced from my other project [Birthday Eevee](https://github.com/anormalperson8/Birthday).

## Version 1.0
- Most planned functions have been implemented!
- This bot allows users to submit questions to the system, moderators to approve them,
and QOTD Eevee will ask them in the designated channel every day.
- Currently, this bot does not support different questions for different servers<br/>
  (i.e. all servers share the same question "database")

#### Version 1.0.1
- Bot now does not ask an empty question when there are no questions available.

## Main files
